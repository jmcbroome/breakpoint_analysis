# breakpoint_analysis
This github repository contains scripts for statistical analysis and figure generation for McBroome et al. All scripts are in python 3.
The primary analysis scripts are divided by analysis type into chromatin, insulators, duplications (tandup), and genome annotations. 
Additional supplementary analysis scripts for breakpoint divergence and figure generation are also included.
