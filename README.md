# breakpoint_analysis
This github repository contains scripts for statistical analysis and figure generation for McBroome et al. All scripts are in python 3.
The four scripts are divided by analysis type into chromatin, insulators, duplications (tandup), and genome annotations. 
The fifth script is an independent script for generating a supplementary figure and relies on the insulator data file.
